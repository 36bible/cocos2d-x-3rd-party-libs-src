cocos2d-x 3rd party libs
========================

This repository includes the source code of the 3rd party libraries (binary) that are bundled with cocos2d-x.

This repository is needed for cocos2d-x developers and/or people who want to port cocos2d-x to other platforms.

As an example, if you want to support cocos2d-x in ARM64, you need to compile all these libraries for ARM64.
